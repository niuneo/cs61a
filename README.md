# CS 61A

sgal's solutions for CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Summer 2019

## Features

**Python one-liners**

I write a lot of one-liners.

One-liner policy:

* Python labs and homeworks are written in one line
* Projects are not, for the sake of readability, unless I really want to
* Scheme and SQL are not written in one-line, because convert them to one line are trivial

**Detailed `.gitignore`**

## Known Issues

* lab 11 and 12 optional questions are not implemented
* Scheme extra questions are not implemented
* Scheme Contest is not implemented
